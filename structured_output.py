LaughRx - Structured Output Implementation
=========================================

Structured Output ensures the AI returns responses in a consistent JSON format
that your frontend can reliably parse and display.

This is crucial for LaughRx because:
1. Frontend needs predictable data structure
2. Easy to separate roast, diagnosis, and advice
3. Can add metadata like confidence scores, severity levels
4. Enables better error handling and validation
