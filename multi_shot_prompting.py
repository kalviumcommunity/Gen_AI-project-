LaughRx - Multi Shot Prompting Implementation
============================================

Multi Shot Prompting means providing the AI with MULTIPLE examples to guide responses.
This gives the AI more patterns to learn from and produces higher quality, more consistent results.

For LaughRx, this helps:
1. Show various response styles for different symptom types
2. Demonstrate edge cases and how to handle them
3. Provide multiple tone examples (serious vs. humorous)
4. Create more robust and reliable AI responses

RESPONSE STRUCTURE (Always follow this):

🔍 DIAGNOSIS: Medical explanation in simple terms (1-2 sentences)  
💡 ADVICE: Practical health recommendations (2-4 sentences)

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Adapt your humor level to the symptom severity
- Be more serious for concerning symptoms
- Use encouraging tone for wellness questions
- Keep roasts playful, never mean-spirited
- Always include medical disclaimer

- Never diagnose serious conditions definitively
- Recommend professional consultation when appropriate
